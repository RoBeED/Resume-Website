        <h2>Summary / About Me:</h2> 
        <p>A true problem solver at heart, Florian thrives in a challenging and fast paced environment, when engaging with customers and internal stakeholders alike. His analytical and objective mindset allow him to stay on top of situations that pose as impossible barriers to others. Agile and resolution oriented, he firmly believes that the best way to move forward in a mutually beneficial professional relationship is to address the root cause of a conflict and work together to transform a barrier into a bond that brings you closer to your customer, your team members, or other stakeholders.</p>
        <p>There is nothing that can materialize such a transformation better than the human touch and while it is of course important that issues are resolved and errors were troubleshot, it is the interaction with the customer and the way the resolution is communicated to them that has a major impact towards their satisfaction with the product or service provider. Florian is an advocate and a champion of directly engaging with stakeholders to help them understand the value proposition of the service/product that is provided. In his eyes it as important to share a narrative with the stakeholders and coach them, to set them up for success, as is resolving the problem itself.</p>
        
        <p>Tell someone repeatedly the same reoccurring issue is resolved, by only addressing the symptoms, and they eventually become disengaged from what you offer.
        Prove to them that you genuinely care about their experience, help them to overcome, and understand why they might have encountered a problem and you have a success story.
        </p>

        <p>Over his time, Florian helped achieve countless of these stories and he is always looking to grow and develop new skills that push his own comfort zone and let him lead by serving others.</p>
